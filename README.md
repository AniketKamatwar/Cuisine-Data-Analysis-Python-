Futures & Highlights

1. Business Problem :

   Food and beverage businesses often struggle to identify the most profitable cuisine and location combinations for new ventures or targeted promotions.


3. Key Questions :

   • Premium Restaurant: Which cuisine and location combination is likely to ensure a restaurant maximizes the total revenue for itself (i.e. most people paying highest budget)

   • Food Truck service: Food Trucks are mobile restaurants that serve low cost food out of the back of a Truck. The restaurateur wants to identify what cuisine is most affordable and the top 3 locations he
     should target with his Trucks.

   • Asian Fusion restaurant: An Asian restauranteur wants to identify which Asian cuisines she should offer in her Asian Kitchen, and where this Kitchen should be located if it is to target the most number of
     people open to Asian cuisine.

   • Alcohol company: A famous Alcohol company wants to increase sales of their alcohol brands. It wants to know what cuisine and locations it should target for its promotional activities.
